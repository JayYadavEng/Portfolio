        <p>The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics host the <a href="https://www.aiaa.org/dbf">Design/Build/Fly competition</a> where about 100 schools compete to perform
            specified missions with radio-controlled aircraft. Columbia was formerly a regular participant, however our club had not attended the competition since 2015 before returning in 2023, my first year at Columbia.
            That year was a great learning experience for both the club and myself to learn how to achieve competition success, even though we had some design flaws and did not get to fly at competition. 
            That experience prepared us well for 2024, when I became the Chief Design Engineer and we had a renewed focus to achieve greater heights.

        <h3>Design Process</h3>
        <img src="dbf_sims.jpg" alt="Design Process" width="600px">
        <p>Our club features an iterative design process with rapid prototyping to adapt our designs through simulation and testing feedback. In 2024, I focused on implementing parametric modelling, rigorous GD&T,
            and practical simulations with FEA and CFD to build a successful design.

        <h3>Competition</h3>
        <img src="dbf_plane.jpg" alt="Competition" width="400px">
        <p>All of our experience and new processes led to our first flights at competition in 2024 and our most successful placement in 10 years. And in 2025, cur club is off to a 
            promising start this year with our design proposal scoring in the top 10% of submissions.

        <h3>Our Team</h3>
        <img src="dbf_team.jpg" alt="Our Team" width="600px">
        <p>   
            While I enjoy working in aeronautics and astronautics equally, the main reason I chose to focus more time on, and take a leadership position in the airplane club was the amazing, close-knit group of students in the club.
            With the team consisting of 10-15 members, I have been able to get my hands on every part of the project, which I truly value. My experience on the <a href="csi.html">rocketry team</a> has been valuable in its own right, 
            but I have mainly been constrained to working on my subteam's projects (the airframe), with less understanding of the big picture.
